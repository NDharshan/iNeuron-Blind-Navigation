# iNeuron-Blind-Navigation
This project attempts to create a system which would bring in added ease to the visually impaired, through our nagivation, obstacle-detection, obstacle distance identification and speech-driven system to seamlessly integrate applications like Ola, Uber, etc. This was built during the PW-Hacks Jan-2023.
